            <span>Hi Liz! You're correct, it is recommended that pregnant women avoid seafood that contains high amounts of mercury, such as swordfish and mackerel. Mercury could interfere with the healthy development of your baby. However, salmon is not one of those and actually contains DHA which aids in healthy development.</span>
